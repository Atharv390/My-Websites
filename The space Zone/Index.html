        <h1>Sun</h1>
        <h3>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma,[18][19]
            heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The Sun radiates this energy mainly as
            light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.

            The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about
            330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.[20] Roughly
            three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much
            smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.[21]

            The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V). As such, it is informally, and not completely accurately,
            referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is actually white). It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a][14][22]
            years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this
            matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar
            System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It
            is thought that almost all stars form by this process.</h3>

        <h1>Moon</h1>
        <h3>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet,[f] with a diameter about one-quarter that of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia).[16] The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term and larger than all known dwarf planets of the Solar System.[17] It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g, with Jupiter's moon Io being the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.

            The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's diameter. Its gravitational influence is the main driver of Earth's tides and very slowly lengthens Earth's day. The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period. However, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through cyclical shifts in perspective known as libration.</h3>

        <h1>Mercury</h1>
        <h3>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun
            takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
            (Mercury),Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in
            a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance,[20] meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly
            three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][21] As seen from the Sun, in a frame of
            reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An
            observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.

            Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about 1⁄30 degree). Its orbital
            eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System;[b] at perihelion, Mercury's distance
            from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface appears
            heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically
            inactive for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures that
            vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System</h3>

        <h1>Venus</h1>
        <h3>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it is
            almost as large and has a similar composition. As an interior planet to Earth, Venus (like Mercury) appears
            in Earth's sky never far from the Sun, either as morning star or evening star. Aside from the Sun and Moon,
            Venus is the brightest natural object in Earth's sky, capable of casting visible shadows on Earth in dark
            conditions and being visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[19][20]Like Mercury, Venus does not have
            any moons.[24] Solar days on Venus, with a length of 117 Earth days,[25] are just about half as long as its
            solar year, orbiting the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[26] This Venusian daylength is a product of it rotating
            against its orbital motion, halving its full sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days, the longest of all
            the Solar System planets. Venus and Uranus are the only planets with such a retrograde rotation, making the
            Sun move in their skies from their western horizon to their eastern. The orbit of Venus around the Sun is
            the closest to Earth's orbit, bringing them closer than any other pair of planets. This occurs during
            inferior conjunction with a synodic period of 1.6 years. However, Mercury is more frequently the closest to
            each.</h3>

        <h1>Earth</h1>
        <h3>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the universe where life has originated
            and found habitability. While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth
            sustains liquid surface water. Approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing
            Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of
            continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which
            interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the
            magnetic field that shapes the magnetosphere of Earth, deflecting destructive solar winds.

            The atmosphere of Earth consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like
            carbon dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. Water vapor is widely
            present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. More solar energy is received by
            tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. A region's
            climate is governed not only by latitude but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. In most
            areas, severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heat waves, occurs and greatly impacts
            life.</h3>

        <h1>Mars</h1>
        <h3>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, larger only than
            Mercury. In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. Mars is a terrestrial planet with
            a thin atmosphere and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core
            made of iron and nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice
            caps. Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos.

            Some of the most notable surface features on Mars include Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and
            highest-known mountain in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar
            System. The Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers approximately 40% of the planet and may be a
            large impact feature.[21] Days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those of Earth, as the planets have a
            similar rotation period and tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane. Liquid water on the
            surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the atmospheric
            pressure on Earth.[22][23] Both of Mars's polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water.[24][25] In the
            distant past, Mars was likely wetter, and thus possibly more suited for life. It is not known whether life
            has ever existed on Mars.</h3>

        <h1>Jupiter</h1>
        <h3>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass
            more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less
            than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's
            night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after
            Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.

            Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, followed by helium, which constitutes a quarter of its mass and a
            tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet
            receives from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, the planet's shape is
            an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided
            into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A
            prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since at least 1831.

            Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere. The planet's
            magnetic tail is nearly 800 million kilometres (5.3 astronomical units; 500 million miles) long. Jupiter has
            92 known moons and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610:
            Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury.
            Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's moon.</h3>

        <h1>Saturn</h1>
        <h3>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a
            gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.[23][24] It has only
            one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[25][26][27]

            Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen,
            an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a
            pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic
            hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's,
            but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field
            strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[28] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in
            contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour
            (1,100 miles per hour), higher than on Jupiter but not as high as on Neptune.[29]

            The planet's most notable feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles,
            with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 83 moons[30] are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53
            are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest
            moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger (while less massive) than the planet Mercury and
            is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.[31]</h3>

        <h1>Uranus</h1>
        <h3>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is named after Greek sky deity Uranus (Caelus), who in Greek
            mythology is the father of Cronus (Saturn), a grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and great-grandfather of Ares
            (Mars). Uranus has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.
            The planet is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from
            those of the other two giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn (the gas giants). For this reason, scientists often
            distinguish Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants".

            As with gas giants, ice giants lack a well-defined solid surface. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to
            Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such
            as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.[17] It has the coldest planetary
            atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 kelvins (−224 °C; −371 °F). It has a
            complex, layered cloud structure; water is thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost
            layer.[17] The planet's interior is mainly composed of ices and rock.[16]

            Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian
            system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of
            its solar orbit. Therefore, its north and south poles lie where most other planets have their equators.[21]
            In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the
            cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets.[21] No other spacecraft has yet visited the
            planet.[22] Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus
            approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).[23]</h3>

        <h1>Neptune</h1>
        <h3>Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the Solar System. It is the
            fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant
            planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is
            denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of
            its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The
            planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion
            kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol
            ♆, representing Neptune's trident.[d]

            Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical
            prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis
            Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After
            Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch
            Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[1] by
            Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was
            discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located
            telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size,
            making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew
            by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune.[17][18] The
            advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently
